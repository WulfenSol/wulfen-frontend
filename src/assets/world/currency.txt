The Wulfen have a primarily coin system renowned for its intricacy and beauty. Gently carved golden layers in waves on one side, in the formation of a kind-faced sun, connecting in a jigsaw formation at the middle; platinum makes up the other side, with small structured and textured indents making up the stoic yet caring face of the moon.These gold and platinum coins are the ones worth most, but there are of course lesser forms of these coins. Bronze and silver are slightly lower tiers, bronze on the sun and silver on the moon, replicating the gold and platinum design but slightly smaller. Ten of these is worth one gold and platinum coin. Finally: the copper and steel coin, and the most common and smallest. Like both of its greater priced coins, it shares the sun and moon design, and 10 of these creates one bronze and silver coin.
