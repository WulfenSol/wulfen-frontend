Starbound Wulfen must have horns (small, medium, large, broken, cracked, etc.).
Non-Starbound Wulfen must have antlers (small, medium, large, broken, cracked, etc.).
All Wulfen (whether starbound or not) must have natural or colored fur.
Colored fur can be bright or dark.

All Wulfen that have color can also have a mix of black or another color (space is colorful after all).
Markings must be either thick or highlighted in some way if fur color is too bright/contrasts with markings.
Colors can also be sploched across the fur (like nebula's).
Hybrids consisting of Wulfen and another species aren't allowed at the moment (might be in the future),
however it's fine to use some of the markings from the species so long as it doesn't cover the back markings and they are the same color as the magic that your Wulfen uses.
