Introduction: Aris
Aris. A beautiful planet, orbiting around the Sun in the same kind of path the Earth is in, yet exactly the opposite side of the Earth, beyond the Sun. It had been foretold years ago, in ancient scrawls of long-dead civilizations, yet only discovered by modern-day technology. At first, the people of Earth were wondering about the aspect of life on this mysterious planet.. So, being the inquisitive kind science committees usually are, they sent signals to it, to see if anything replied. To everyone's surprise.. there was a reply. In fact.. there were multiple ... dozens even.

Science fiction didn't help Earth's idea of extraterrestrial life.. So, clearly, they were cautious. But, after further contact, it was clear: The Arisians - Wulfen, as they liked to be called - were friendly, and wanted to establish good relations with Earth.

Soon enough, the Earth-Aris Transit system - EAT, for short - was established, thanks to the Wulfens' surprising technological advancement beyond what Earth had.
