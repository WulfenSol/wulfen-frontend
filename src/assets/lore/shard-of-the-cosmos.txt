Wulfen II: Shard of the Cosmos
Unbeknownst to the Wulfen population, the very land deep beneath their feet was rich with magical potential. Great powers that no one, not even the Aequil tribe or the Aer tribe, could predict. Control over the elements - the water, the fire, the wind - all were within their grasp. Alas, the first generation of Wulfen to have ever experienced these great and wonderful powers first had to experience something terrible and traumatic - the arrival of the Shard of the Cosmos. 

The Shard of the Cosmos was, and remains to be, the most devastating things to have happened to Aris. The Shard, a comet of massive proportions, and rumored to have the stellar constellations etched into its surface, was seen streaking across the night sky, long ago, many centuries even before the dawn of civilization on Earth. However, the Shard, as if drawn to Aris by some will of the gods of old, had changed its course one fateful year, and was sent hurtling into Aris' surface...
The resulting damage was catastrophic.

Or.. at least it should have been according to how we thought their world workedâ€¦ something quite peculiar happened instead...

A force within the very ground of Aris resonated with the Shard, moments before it struck. The Shard resonated in response, before suddenly splintering into many fragments. Some small, some big. As far as the stories go, each tribe has a recorded instance of a fragment landing in their villages. Most reported damage, or injuries, but not a single death, neither was the damage irreparable.

The fragments - later called Seeds of the Cosmos - were treasured by the tribes, as a memorial to what happened that fateful day, as well as a gift from the gods.

This generation experienced strange and new things in their respective environments. Things that could only be described as.. magical. However, this was only the beginning.
