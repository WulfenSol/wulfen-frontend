Wulfen III: Birth of Magic
As the first generation of Wulfen to experience the Shard aged, they would bare children to the world. However, to their immediate shock and perhaps horror, all the tribes noted a familiar trend: in the next generation some Wulfen were bearing marks that resembled the constellations in the sky. Each tribe reported different colors and markings, dependent on the region; the Grand Deserts gave fiery-red markings, while the Vast Plains gave an airy . The Frozen Tundras produced icy/dark blue markings, while the Highest Peaks and Endless Forests produced silver and green markings, respectively.

There is only one known exception to this: the Aequil tribes. Children born in the tribes of Aequil either were born with golden markings, or shadowy gray markings. 

The brilliant minds of Aer deduced a theory: It was a gift from the gods, an effect produced by the Seeds of the Cosmos that were produced by the Shard.

As these children grew and developed, they discovered that they were blessed with powers and abilities far beyond what their ancestors, even their parents, could grasp. Children of Sur were blessed with blazing fires, while Children of Aer were blessed with gusting gales and zephyrs. Children of Pol were blessed with both gushing rivers of both water and ice. Children of Sundur were granted powers over tectonics and vegetation, depending on their home, the Highest Peaks, or the Endless Forests. The Children of Aequil were blessed with either the brightest of lights, or the darkest of shadows, depending on their markings.

The Royal Families of Aequil were also blessed with a special ability, one which none of the other Wulfen were given: A special, heightened state of being, which grants the wielder intensified powers over their dominion, as well as heightened senses and feelings. For those who wield this power, one can often decisively indicate this form by a golden or silver glint in their eyes, as well as an effect dependent on the will and spirit of the wielder. 

From that point onwards, the Wulfen population would utilize their gifts to the advancement of their culture, their lives, and the world, in both technology and in magic.

Now, not all Wulfen were blessed with these magical powers. Those that were blessed with these powers are called Starbound Wulfen. Those who are not Starbound - your average Wulfen - can still use magic, however! They need fragments and pieces of the Seeds of the Cosmos to function as talismans for them in order to use magic.

The main physical differences between Wulfen that are Starbound and not Starbound, is that Starbound Wulfen have horns, while Wulfen that are not Starbound have antlers, as well as not having star markings.
