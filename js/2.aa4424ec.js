A beautiful planet, orbiting around the Sun in the same kind of path the Earth is in, yet exactly the opposite side of the Earth, beyond the Sun. It had been foretold years ago, in ancient scrawls of long-dead civilizations, yet only discovered by modern-day technology. At first, the people of Earth were wondering about the aspect of life on this mysterious planet.. So, being the inquisitive kind science committees usually are, they sent signals to it, to see if anything replied. To everyone's surprise.. there was a reply. In fact.. there were multiple ... dozens even.\n\nScience fiction didn't help Earth's idea of extraterrestrial life.. So, clearly, they were cautious. But, after further contact, it was clear: The Arisians - Wulfen, as they liked to be called - were friendly, and wanted to establish good relations with Earth.\n\nSoon enough, the Earth-Aris Transit system - EAT, for short - was established, thanks to the Wulfens' surprising technological advancement beyond what Earth had.\n"},"6b46":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("ec7f")},aca4:function(e,t){e.exports="Wulfen II: Shard of the Cosmos\nUnbeknownst to the Wulfen population, the very land deep beneath their feet was rich with magical potential. Great powers that no one, not even the Aequil tribe or the Aer tribe, could predict. Control over the elements - the water, the fire, the wind - all were within their grasp. Alas, the first generation of Wulfen to have ever experienced these great and wonderful powers first had to experience something terrible and traumatic - the arrival of the Shard of the Cosmos. \n\nThe Shard of the Cosmos was, and remains to be, the most devastating things to have happened to Aris. The Shard, a comet of massive proportions, and rumored to have the stellar constellations etched into its surface, was seen streaking across the night sky, long ago, many centuries even before the dawn of civilization on Earth. However, the Shard, as if drawn to Aris by some will of the gods of old, had changed its course one fateful year, and was sent hurtling into Aris' surface...\nThe resulting damage was catastrophic.\n\nOr.. at least it should have been according to how we thought their world workedâ€¦ something quite peculiar happened instead...\n\nA force within the very ground of Aris resonated with the Shard, moments before it struck. The Shard resonated in response, before suddenly splintering into many fragments. Some small, some big. As far as the stories go, each tribe has a recorded instance of a fragment landing in their villages. Most reported damage, or injuries, but not a single death, neither was the damage irreparable.\n\nThe fragments - later called Seeds of the Cosmos - were treasured by the tribes, as a memorial to what happened that fateful day, as well as a gift from the gods.\n\nThis generation experienced strange and new things in their respective environments. Things that could only be described as.. magical. However, this was only the beginning.\n"},b2a0:function(e,t){e.exports="Wulfen I: Heraldic Tribes\n\nWulfen were, from the very start, less one entire civilization, and more so different groups of tribal societies. There were different tribes that thrived in different ways. There are too many to list, but, there are several large ones: The Sul tribe of the Grand Deserts, the Aer Tribe of the Vast Plains and Endless Forests, the Pol tribe of the Frozen Tundras and Highest Peaks, the Sundur Tribe of the Majestic Oceans/Lakes and Incredible Storms, and the Aequil Tribes of the Brightest Light and Darkest Shadow. The tribes all performed differently, and coexisted in many ways. \n\nThe Sul tribes are, and always were, the hardiest tribes, being able to live off the unforgiving landscape of the desert. Their bodies had adapted to the harsh lifestyle of living in arid environments, giving them a distinct look from other Wulfen of Aris. They are easily able to be picked out of a crowd.\n\nThe Aer tribes have always paid claim to being the most scholarly of the Tribes, and everyone on Aris agrees. The perfect night skies laid out the stars for them to see, to learn from. This proved to be very, very important to all Wulfen for a reason not yet discussed.\n\nThe Pol tribes embrace the cold, deeming it a necessary part of life itself. These almost nomadic tribes live for the moment, and, despite having the least amount of claimed land, often produce the most adventurous and brave of Wulfen. How else would you be able to track and kill prey in a place where literally anything can kill you, if you weren't brave or courageous?\n\nThe Sundur tribes are hands-down the wealthiest of the tribes, the depths of the ocean has many treasures after all. Having access to trade routes among all the tribes through underground tunnels, and access to a majority of the mines on Aris will do that. Despite this, they are also the most philanthropic of the Wulfen, going out of their way to ensure all is good in the land. \n\nThe Aequil tribe can easily be described with two words: Law and order. The Aequil tribe is regarded as the oldest tribe, the first Wulfen tribe. Major cases of legal discussion are dealt in Aequil jurisdiction, and are dealt with both fairness and equality. All the tribes regard the Aequil tribe as a tribe of royalty - an honored, esteemed organization of Wulfen hierarchies. Aequil is often considered the capital of all of Aris for these reasons.\n\nEach tribe had a god that they believed in. Each god had a stellar object associated with them. The Sul tribe was tied to blazing Mercury; the Aer tribe, verdant Earth; the Pol tribe, frosted Neptune; the Sundur tribe, storming Jupiter; the Aequil tribe believed in both the darkest Moon and the brightest Sun.\n"},ec7f:function(e,t,a){},f7b0:function(e,t){e.exports="Wulfen III: Birth of Magic\nAs the first generation of Wulfen to experience the Shard aged, they would bare children to the world. However, to their immediate shock and perhaps horror, all the tribes noted a familiar trend: in the next generation some Wulfen were bearing marks that resembled the constellations in the sky. Each tribe reported different colors and markings, dependent on the region; the Grand Deserts gave fiery-red markings, while the Vast Plains and Endless Forests produced airy silver and lushful green markings, respectively. The Frozen Tundras and Highest Peaks produced icy/dark blue markings, while the Majestic Oceans/Lakes and Incredible Storms produced flowing blue and electrifying yellow markings.\n\nThere is only one known exception to this: the Aequil tribes. Children born in the tribes of Aequil either were born with bright golden markings, or shadowy purple markings. \n\nThe brilliant and scholarly minds of Aer deduced a theory: It was a gift from the gods, an effect produced by the Seeds of the Cosmos that were produced by the Shard.\n\nAs these children grew and developed, they discovered that they were blessed with powers and abilities far beyond what their ancestors, even their parents, could grasp. Children of Sur were blessed with blazing fires. Children of Aer were blessed with gusting gales and magnificant flora, depending on if they lived in the Vast Plains or Endless Forests. Children of Pol were blessed with frigid ice. Children of Sundur were blessed with both gushing rivers and echoing lightning, depending on their markings. The Children of Aequil were blessed with either the brightest of lights, or the darkest of shadows, depending on their markings.\n\nThe Royal Families of Aequil were also blessed with a special ability, one which none of the other Wulfen were given: A special, heightened state of being, which grants the wielder intensified powers over their dominion, as well as heightened senses and feelings. For those who wield this power, one can often decisively indicate this form by a golden or silver glint in their eyes, as well as an effect dependent on the will and spirit of the wielder. \n\nFrom that point onwards, the Wulfen population would utilize their gifts to the advancement of their culture, their lives, and the world, in both technology and in magic.\n\nAll Wulfen were blessed with these magical powers, however their innate magical ability differs. Those that were blessed with high magical ability are called Starbound Wulfen. Those who are Non-Starbound can still use magic, however, they need fragments and pieces of the Seeds of the Cosmos. These usually come in the form of gems and function as talismans for them in order to use magic on the level of a Starbound Wulfen.\n\nThe main physical differences between Wulfen that are Starbound and Non-Starbound, is that Starbound Wulfen have horns and constellation markings, while Non-Starbound Wulfen have antlers that can grow different kinds of plants, as well as not having star markings.\n"}}]);
