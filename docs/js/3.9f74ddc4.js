Snake rats are small and blend in well, always hunting for snow beans while digging at high speeds through the snow. The owl bear has a white coat, and hunts anything it can get its claws on. It is dangerously carnivorous and frighteningly fast.\r\n\r\nMuch like a snake rat, the wyrm creates intricate tunnels in the desert sand, sometimes for transport or convenience, but also sometimes to transport water to an oasis they plan to make their homes. Shultures are vicious birds that have an acidic spit with the strangest property: it makes you float for a short amount of time, always upwards.\r\n\r\nThe flying snakes vary in color, but their angelic like wings are always white. Small in form and very docile, they live peacefully in the mountains. However, dwelling deep within the caves are giant bats. Similar to earth’s variant, but as big as any humanoid, much larger than it has any right to be. They hunt the sundur who stray too deep from their calling in the mines, though they aren’t anything horribly powerful.\r\n\r\nFor some obscure reason, this thriving ecosystem lacks any predators. Small avians, rodents, and even the occasional canines litter the red forest, but they’re all deeply enthralled by peace and even help each other out, occasionally scavenging meals together.\r\n\r\nCommon fish of course dwell here in the river, but they are nothing compared to the shark snakes guarding each sharded tree, bigger than three wulfen combined and their for the sole purpose to serve.\r\n\r\nThe sea bed itself, the very core of Aris, is alive. When the shard landed on Aris, it instilled a deity’s soul into the planet, and out of the floor swim fish, bigger fish, and the biggest of all fish, gilled whales. Apart from these, the wolf serpent guards the world tree, not unlike the shark snakes but bigger and far deadlier, although also like the other ones, it would never in a million years attack the wulfen.\r\n"},"88cb":function(e,t){e.exports="Eco 1: Currency\r\nThe Wulfen have a primarily coin system renowned for its intricacy and beauty. Gently carved golden layers in waves on one side, in the formation of a kind-faced sun, connecting in a jigsaw formation at the middle; platinum makes up the other side, with small structured and textured indents making up the stoic yet caring face of the moon.These gold and platinum coins are the ones worth most, but there are of course lesser forms of these coins. Bronze and silver are slightly lower tiers, bronze on the sun and silver on the moon, replicating the gold and platinum design but slightly smaller. Ten of these is worth one gold and platinum coin. Finally: the copper and steel coin, and the most common and smallest. Like both of its greater priced coins, it shares the sun and moon design, and 10 of these creates one bronze and silver coin.\r\n"},9234:function(e,t){e.exports="Eco 2: Flora\r\n\r\nThroughout the many different terrains of Aris; though similar to Earth, many species of plant are identified as specifically unique: especially those located only in one biome.\r\n\r\nIn the plains, a deep, thorough green spans the ground; blades of grass portraying the lushness of Aris. Whenever the wind howls here, air travels through the hollow reeds and creates a beautiful whistling sound. Additionally, an evolved form of photosynthesis allows wind to replace sunlight, or vice versa. The Aer tribe will use this grass as musical instruments or even signs from the gods during traditions.\r\n\r\nWithin the tundra, only one thing can survive beneath the grasses- frost beans. Growing from stiff blue stalks, these silver pods contain 3-4 beans per pocket, and only grow under pressure, with high levels of moisture, and also within a shell of deep, extreme cold. These plants don’t require sun to grow, and take their health from the frigid lack of heat. Because of their eternal survival in the snow, the Pol tribe uses these as a main food source.\r\n\r\nThe sand in this desert is different, to say the least. Although still lacking the potential of soil, it charges through the kinetic; sprouting cacti of varying sizes at alarming rates. Specifically: the hollow points of the common rose cacti can serve as medical tools, eating utensils, or even a toothpick for the most daring of warriors! As an added bonus, the desert hunters gain hydration and even fulfillment from eating or drinking either the rose buds or whatever follows out of the hole from which the hollow needle is plucked out of.\r\n\r\nPiercing the clouds as a deft blade pierces a carrot, the mountains rise to varying heights; all of impressive stature. The dwellers of this enchanting place; the Sundur tribe, are extremely hard workers, which shows and pays off in humongous excrements. By far the wealthiest, they get a large export of goods from the deep mines of the peaks, harboring a knack for finding oddities in the most unlikely of places, and making these oddities into something useful for the entire planet. You’d think, from looking afar at these mountains, they would be laden with snow, but really the snow is light compared to the tundra at least, and the white powder shielding the peaks are actually huge fields of dandelions, which the sundur children relish playing in.\r\n\r\nThe red forests, lush with maple leaves native to the most beautiful season of autumn, populate Aris creating an awe inspiring environment for those of the sundur who would prefer low, dim, pure nature over high peaks and coal ridden sparkling caves.\r\n\r\nThe rivers and lakes of Aris are nothing short of gorgeous: red and green and blue weeds growing from the soft soil bed, natural inlets serving as docks for the travelling inhabitants, and the most special part about these: the five great lakes. Lakes formed from; supposedly, the tears of the very gods themselves. In the midst of each of these huge lakes lies a tree, each imbued with a little shard magic, which enhances a wulfen’s connection whenever they’re near. Each of these trees have an appearance collaborating to the place they are in; white and black with minimal leaves for the frozen lake of Pielyr, almost cactus like for Solstice, the boiling lake, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe great Aritian Ocean, the original site of the Shard of the Cosmos’s crashing into Aris, and home of the esteemed Aequil tribes. Not unlike the lakes, in the very center of the ocean lies the world tree. Each branch is uniquely representative, and its trunk is only described as a collaboration between light and dark: silver flowing through the folded creases of shining gold, creating a riveting balance in between chaos. In the center of this tree is where the original Shard of the Cosmos landed, but nobody knows which came first; the tree of the shard?\r\n"},a8f9:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var n=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("q-page",{staticClass:"row justify-center items-start "},[a("div",{staticClass:"text-content col-12 col-md-8 col-sm-10"},[a("div",{staticStyle:{height:"50px"}}),a("q-stepper",{ref:"stepper",attrs:{"header-nav":"",vertical:"",color:"primary",animated:""},model:{value:e.path,callback:function(t){e.path=t},expression:"path"}},[a("q-step",{attrs:{name:"/world/currency",title:"Currency",icon:"book","active-icon":"remove_red_eye"}},[a("p",[e._v(e._s(e.currency.trim()))]),a("q-stepper-navigation",[a("q-btn",{attrs:{color:"primary",label:"Continue"},on:{click:function(t){e.path="/world/flora"}}})],1)],1),a("q-step",{attrs:{name:"/world/flora",title:"Flora",icon:"book","active-icon":"remove_red_eye"}},[a("q-img",{staticClass:"inline-image",attrs:{src:"icons/Librarian_Sol_icon_gray-256.png","spinner-color":"white"}}),a("p",[e._v(e._s(e.flora.trim()))]),a("q-stepper-navigation",[a("q-btn",{attrs:{color:"primary",label:"Continue"},on:{click:function(t){e.path="/world/fauna"}}}),a("q-btn",{staticClass:"q-ml-sm",attrs:{flat:"",color:"primary",label:"Back"},on:{click:function(t){e.path="/world/currency"}}})],1)],1),a("q-step",{attrs:{name:"/world/fauna",title:"Fauna",icon:"book","active-icon":"remove_red_eye"}},[a("p",[e._v(e._s(e.fauna.trim()))]),a("q-stepper-navigation",[a("q-btn",{attrs:{color:"primary",label:"Lore"},on:{click:function(t){e.path="/lore/introduction"}}}),a("q-btn",{staticClass:"q-ml-sm",attrs:{flat:"",color:"primary",label:"Back"},on:{click:function(t){e.path="/world/flora"}}})],1)],1)],1)],1),a("q-page-scroller",{attrs:{position:"bottom-right","scroll-offset":150,offset:[18,18]}},[a("q-btn",{attrs:{fab:"",icon:"keyboard_arrow_up",color:"accent"}})],1)],1)},r=[],o=a("e4fd"),i=a("88cb"),s=a.n(i),l=a("9234"),h=a.n(l),c=a("519f"),d=a.n(c),u=Object(o["defineComponent"])({name:"WorldPage",setup(){return{currency:s.a,flora:h.a,fauna:d.a}},computed:{path:{get(){return this.$route.path},set(e){this.$router.replace(e).catch((e=>{if("NavigationDuplicated"!==e.name)throw e}))}}}}),f=u,g=(a("f284"),a("2877")),p=a("9989"),m=a("f531"),w=a("87fe"),y=a("b19c"),b=a("9c40"),v=a("068f"),k=a("5096"),q=a("eebe"),_=a.n(q),S=Object(g["a"])(f,n,r,!1,null,"ab706762",null);t["default"]=S.exports;_()(S,"components",{QPage:p["a"],QStepper:m["a"],QStep:w["a"],QStepperNavigation:y["a"],QBtn:b["a"],QImg:v["a"],QPageScroller:k["a"]})},bc88:function(e,t,a){},f284:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("bc88")}}]);
